countdown problem solution

The Countdown numbers game is specified as follows:

Players are given six integer numbers and a target integer number
The six numbers should be combined using the mathematical operators + - * and / in a way that gets as close as possible to the target number. Each number can only be used at most once, but it is okay not to use a number
Getting the target number is worth 10 points, getting within 5 of the target is worth 7 points, getting within 10 is worth 5 points.
For instance if the numbers are (100,4,17,9,3,2) and the target is 37, then one way to do this is (100 / (3 + 2)) + 17, which would get the full 10 points.
